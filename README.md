## Notes for Running

**Body:**  
Please do not use preview in order to run this project. Please execute on the simulator in order for the animations to work fluidly. The preview causes sync issues with states amongst the views which would cause it to not animate.

## Notes for Personal Improvement

**Body:**  
**Reusability:** I created a card view in order for it to be reusable, but encountered a small error with width spacing when I made it full screen. I did ensure I followed best practices by making new files for the different larger components, but if I had more time I would re-use the card view in the full screen view to ensure I am not repeating code. Additionally, I would consider breaking it down further into components as I receive more input about criteria of the components of the app card upon expansion and how they might vary.

**Animation:** I placed an emphasis on the image and animation styles as noted in the Notion. If I were to do this project again, I would choose the cover photo to be scaled slightly differently as the horizontal nature of the photo made it difficult for it to work well as an app card. Additionally, I manually blurred the image to mimic the app style, but if given more time, I would change the image to be longer vertically to make the blur more fluid.
